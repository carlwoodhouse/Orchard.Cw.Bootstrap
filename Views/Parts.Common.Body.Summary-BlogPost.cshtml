@*doing excerpt generation on the way out for now so we don't stick ourselves with needing to regen excerpts for existing data
  also, doing this here, inline, until we have a pluggable processing model (both in and out)
  also, ...this is ugly *@
@{ 
    string bodyHtml = Model.Html.ToString();
    var body = new HtmlString(Html.Excerpt(bodyHtml, 150).ToString().Replace(Environment.NewLine, "</p>" + Environment.NewLine + "<p>")); 
}

@body
